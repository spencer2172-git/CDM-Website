# CDM-Website
For my website, I will be creating a portfolio of all the skills I've learned throughout this class, namely gimp and audacity. I would also like to showcase some of the coding skills I have gained throughout my time at Pitt. To do this, I will implement a page that holds 1 or 2 of my more technically difficult projects, likely using java-based projects. The home page will include links to each of these pages, where a quick paragraph will explain the skills used, intent of each project, and other necessary notes. My bio will be held on its own page rather than the home page. This page will contain a quick introduction to myself and what I would want people to know about me. It will then go into a brief description of my skills and then link to my LinkedIn page. This page will also include a picture of myself, almost like a 'profile picture'.
